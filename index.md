### Welcome

Hello, I am Megha Dhingra, and I am currently a student at UC Berkeley, pursuing a major in computer science and a minor in human rights. I am passionate about harnessing the power of technology for social impact. In my free time, I enjoy working on programming side projects that intersect with politics.
